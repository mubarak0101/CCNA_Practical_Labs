# Rapid-PVST, PortFast, and BPDU Guard Network Configuration

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (Rapid PVST)**, **PortFast**, and **BPDU Guard** in a network topology to optimize convergence times, improve end-user experience, and enhance network security by preventing potential switching loops. Rapid PVST provides fast convergence with per-VLAN optimization, while PortFast and BPDU Guard offer instant connectivity and protection on access ports.

## Background on Rapid PVST, PortFast, and BPDU Guard

### Rapid PVST
**Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (Rapid PVST)** is an enhancement of the IEEE Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP). Cisco developed Rapid PVST to allow each VLAN to run its own independent spanning tree instance, which provides more granular control over traffic and optimizes the path for each VLAN. Key advantages of Rapid PVST include:
- **Faster Convergence**: Rapid PVST converges much faster than traditional STP by leveraging rapid transition states, minimizing network downtime during link failures or topology changes.
- **Per-VLAN Optimization**: Each VLAN can have its own root bridge, enabling better traffic balancing and optimized path selection.

### PortFast
**PortFast** is a feature of STP that allows switch ports connected to end devices to skip the typical STP listening and learning states and immediately enter the forwarding state. This reduces the delay for these devices to connect to the network, making it ideal for ports that donâ€™t connect to other switches. Benefits of PortFast include:
- **Instant Connectivity**: End devices, such as computers and printers, experience almost immediate network connectivity.
- **Reduced STP Processing**: Since PortFast ports do not participate in the STP topology, they reduce the overhead on STP calculations.

> **Important**: PortFast should only be used on ports connecting to end devices, as enabling it on trunk ports or uplinks can create network loops.

### BPDU Guard
**BPDU Guard** works with PortFast to enhance security by automatically disabling any PortFast-enabled port if a BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) is received on that port. BPDUs are STP packets used to detect loops, so BPDU Guard ensures that no network loop can be created from an accidental or malicious connection of switches or other network devices to an access port. Key features of BPDU Guard include:
- **Loop Prevention**: Disables ports immediately if a BPDU is received, which is crucial in preventing loops in the network.
- **Enhanced Security**: Ensures that only end devices are connected to access ports, protecting against accidental or intentional misconfigurations.

## Network Topology

This topology includes:
- **Switches**: Three Cisco 2960 switches (Switch0, Switch1, and Switch2) connected in a triangular formation for redundancy.
- **PCs**: Three end devices (PC0, PC1, and PC2) connected to each switch using PortFast-enabled access ports.
- **VLANs**: Traffic separation and PVST instances for each VLAN can be configured as needed.

## Objectives
1. Configure **Rapid PVST** to support fast convergence and per-VLAN control.
2. Enable **PortFast** on access ports to provide immediate connectivity for end devices.
3. Configure **BPDU Guard** on PortFast-enabled ports to enhance security and prevent network loops.

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Enable Rapid PVST on All Switches
Set the spanning tree mode to Rapid PVST to ensure quick convergence and VLAN-specific spanning tree instances.

**Global Command:**
```plaintext
Switch(config)# spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
```

### Step 2: Configure PortFast on Access Ports
Enable PortFast on all access ports connected to end devices (e.g., PCs) to bypass STP listening and learning states and directly enter the forwarding state.

**Example Configuration for PortFast on Interface Fa0/3:**
```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface fa0/3
Switch(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
```

This configuration should be repeated for each access port connecting to an end device on each switch.

### Step 3: Enable BPDU Guard on PortFast-Enabled Ports
BPDU Guard protects the network by automatically shutting down any PortFast-enabled port if it receives a BPDU. This can be configured per port or globally.

**Per-Port Configuration:**
```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface fa0/3
Switch(config-if)# spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```

**Global Configuration (for all PortFast-enabled ports):**
```plaintext
Switch(config)# spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
```

When configured globally, BPDU Guard will be enabled on every PortFast-enabled port across the switch.

### Step 4: Configure Verification Commands
After configuration, verify the setup to ensure all features are correctly enabled.

#### Verification Commands:

1. **Check Rapid PVST Status**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show spanning-tree summary
   ```
   This command confirms that Rapid PVST is enabled and displays the spanning tree status for all VLANs.

2. **Verify PortFast on Interfaces**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show spanning-tree interface fa0/3 portfast
   ```
   This command verifies that PortFast is enabled on a specific interface (e.g., Fa0/3).

3. **Check BPDU Guard Status**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show spanning-tree interface fa0/3 detail
   ```
   This command shows detailed STP information for an interface, including BPDU Guard status.

4. **Verify Global BPDU Guard Setting**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show running-config | include bpduguard
   ```
   This command displays the running configuration to confirm that BPDU Guard is set to default for all PortFast-enabled interfaces.

## Practical Use Case Scenarios

1. **Instant User Connectivity**: PortFast ensures that end devices such as computers and phones experience immediate network connectivity upon being connected to the switch.
2. **Loop Prevention**: BPDU Guard prevents accidental loops caused by users connecting switches or hubs to PortFast-enabled ports.
3. **Network Resilience**: Rapid PVST allows fast recovery from link failures, ensuring minimal downtime and optimal paths for data flows within each VLAN.
