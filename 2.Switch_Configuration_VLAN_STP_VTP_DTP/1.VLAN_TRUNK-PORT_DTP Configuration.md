# VLAN & Trunk Port Configuration

## Network Topology Overview

This topology demonstrates the configuration of VLANs and trunking on switches with two departments: HR and Finance. The configuration includes VLAN setup, switchport modes, trunk port configuration, and details about DTP.


## Configuration Details

### VLAN Configuration:
We are using two VLANs for segmenting network traffic:

- **VLAN 10**: HR Team
- **VLAN 20**: Finance Team

### Switchport Configuration

Configure switch ports for access to the appropriate VLANs.

#### HR Team (VLAN 10):
```bash
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name HR
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
Switch(config)# interface range fa0/2-6
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

#### Finance Team (VLAN 20):
```bash
Switch(config)# vlan 20
Switch(config-vlan)# name FINANCE
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
Switch(config)# interface range fa0/7-11
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 20
Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

### Trunk Port Configuration

To allow VLAN traffic between switches, configure a trunk port. This port will carry traffic from multiple VLANs (VLAN 10 and VLAN 20).

```bash
Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
Switch(config-if)# exit
```

### What is a Trunk Port?

- A **Trunk Port** is a port configured to carry traffic for multiple VLANs across switches. 
- It enables communication between VLANs across different switches by tagging traffic with VLAN IDs.
- **Trunking** is vital in larger networks where multiple VLANs span across various network devices.

By default, trunk ports can carry traffic from all VLANs, but we can restrict it to specific VLANs using the `allowed vlan` command:
```bash
Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
```

## Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)

### Overview:

**Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)** is a Cisco proprietary protocol that dynamically negotiates trunking between two switches or between a switch and another network device. DTP simplifies the process of setting up trunk links by automating the creation of trunks, but it is only supported on Cisco devices and is enabled by default on many Cisco switch ports.

#### Benefits of DTP:
- **Automatic Trunk Negotiation**: Reduces the manual steps involved in setting up trunk links.
- **Simplified Network Management**: Automatically detects and adjusts trunk settings without requiring user intervention.
- **Error Minimization**: Decreases the likelihood of misconfigurations when establishing trunk links.

#### DTP Modes:
DTP operates in different modes, which define how a switch negotiates trunking with its peer:

1. **Dynamic Auto**:
   - The port will **passively** wait for the other side to request trunking. It will become a trunk only if the other side is set to `desirable` or `trunk` mode.
   - This is the **default mode** on many Cisco switches.

2. **Dynamic Desirable**:
   - The port will **actively** attempt to negotiate a trunk link with the other side. It will form a trunk if the peer is set to `auto`, `desirable`, or `trunk`.

3. **Trunk**:
   - The port is **manually configured** to be a trunk. It will not negotiate trunking but will simply send and receive trunk frames.

4. **Access**:
   - The port is explicitly configured to be an access port and **will not participate** in DTP negotiations. The port is locked into access mode and carries traffic only for a single VLAN.

5. **Nonegotiate**:
   - The port is statically configured to trunk mode but **does not send DTP frames**. This disables DTP negotiation and is often used for security purposes to ensure the port stays in trunk mode.

#### DTP Mode Configuration:

```bash
# Dynamic Auto Mode (passively waits to form a trunk)
Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode dynamic auto

# Dynamic Desirable Mode (actively tries to form a trunk)
Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode dynamic desirable

# Disable DTP (Nonegotiate) for static trunk
Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
Switch(config-if)# switchport nonegotiate
```

### Security Concerns with DTP:

While DTP simplifies trunk formation, it also poses some security risks:

1. **VLAN Hopping Attacks**:
   - Attackers could take advantage of DTP by sending spoofed DTP messages to force a switchport into trunk mode, gaining access to multiple VLANs. This is known as **VLAN hopping**.

2. **Unauthorized Trunk Links**:
   - If DTP is left enabled on unused ports or access ports, attackers may exploit it to establish unauthorized trunk links.

#### How to Mitigate DTP Security Risks:

1. **Disable DTP on Access Ports**:
   - Manually configure ports as **access ports** and disable DTP to prevent them from becoming trunk ports unintentionally.
   ```bash
   Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/2
   Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
   Switch(config-if)# switchport nonegotiate
   ```

2. **Disable DTP on Trunk Ports**:
   - Disable DTP on trunk links where trunk negotiation is not needed.
   ```bash
   Switch(config)# interface fastethernet 0/1
   Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
   Switch(config-if)# switchport nonegotiate
   ```

3. **Enable Port Security**:
   - Implement port security to restrict which devices can connect to a port.

### DTP Best Practices:

- **Disable DTP** on all access ports by using the command `switchport nonegotiate`.
- **Manually configure trunk ports** and disable DTP negotiation to ensure that the port remains in trunk mode.
- For inter-switch links, use **static trunking** with the `nonegotiate` option to avoid unnecessary DTP traffic.
- When not required, completely **disable trunking** on ports that are meant to operate as access ports.
- Regularly audit your switch configurations to ensure that ports are properly configured to avoid unauthorized trunking and VLAN hopping.

### Additional Information

- **VLAN Segmentation** helps in dividing the network into logical parts, improving security and reducing broadcast domains.
- **Trunking** enables communication between multiple VLANs across switches.
- **DTP** simplifies trunk negotiation, but it can also be a security risk if not properly managed. It is generally advisable to disable DTP when it's not needed.
