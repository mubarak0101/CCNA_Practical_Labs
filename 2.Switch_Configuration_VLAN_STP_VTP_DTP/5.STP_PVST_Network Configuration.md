# STP and PVST Network Configuration

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** and **Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)** in a network topology designed to ensure redundancy, prevent loops, and provide VLAN-based traffic optimization. The network consists of three main switches and multiple PCs, separated into two VLANs (HR and IT). This configuration showcases a layered approach to spanning tree, allowing for efficient traffic management within each VLAN.

## Background on STP and PVST

### Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
The **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** is a network protocol that prevents loops in a switched Ethernet network by creating a loop-free logical topology. STP dynamically disables redundant paths and activates backup paths when necessary. This ensures that traffic is routed only through the designated paths and avoids broadcast storms or packet duplication.

### Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)
**Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)** is a Cisco enhancement of STP that allows a separate spanning tree instance for each VLAN. With PVST, each VLAN can have its own root bridge and tree structure, allowing different paths to be active for different VLANs, optimizing bandwidth usage across the network. PVST+ extends this feature further to be compatible with 802.1Q, enhancing interoperability across networks.

## Network Topology

The network topology consists of:
- **Switches**: Three main Cisco switches connected in a triangular formation for redundancy.
- **PCs**: Devices connected to each switch, each assigned to specific VLANs (HR and IT).
- **VLANs**:
  - **VLAN 10** - HR (IP Range: 192.10.1.0/24)
  - **VLAN 20** - IT (IP Range: 192.10.2.0/24)
  
This setup leverages **PVST** to assign different root bridges per VLAN and control spanning tree paths, ensuring an efficient and loop-free topology.

## Objectives
1. Configure and assign VLANs for network segmentation.
2. Set up root bridges for each VLAN to control path selection.
3. Prevent network loops using STP and PVST.
4. Assign specific ports to each VLAN on each switch to separate traffic and ensure security.

## Configuration Steps

### 1. VLAN Configuration
Define VLANs on each switch to separate HR and IT departments:
```plaintext
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name HR
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
Switch(config)# vlan 20
Switch(config-vlan)# name IT
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
```

### 2. Assign Access Ports to VLANs
Set switch ports to access mode and assign them to the correct VLANs:
- **Port Fa0/3** for VLAN 10 (HR)
- **Port Fa0/4** for VLAN 20 (IT)

**Example Configuration for Access Ports:**
```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface fa0/3
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config)# interface fa0/4
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 20
```

### 3. Configure Root Bridge for Each VLAN (PVST)

For PVST to optimize traffic, each VLAN requires a separate root bridge. By designating one switch as the root bridge for VLAN 10 and another for VLAN 20, we can ensure optimized path selection and load balancing.

- **Switch2 as the root bridge for VLAN 10**
    ```plaintext
    Switch2(config)# spanning-tree vlan 10 root primary
    ```

- **Switch0 as the root bridge for VLAN 20**
    ```plaintext
    Switch0(config)# spanning-tree vlan 20 root primary
    ```

### 4. Configure Secondary Root Bridge (Backup)

Setting a secondary root bridge provides redundancy in case the primary root bridge fails. By defining a secondary root, we allow PVST to switch paths without significant delays.

- **Switch1 as the secondary root for VLAN 10**
    ```plaintext
    Switch1(config)# spanning-tree vlan 10 root secondary
    ```

- **Switch1 as the secondary root for VLAN 20**
    ```plaintext
    Switch1(config)# spanning-tree vlan 20 root secondary
    ```

### 5. Verification
After configuring STP and PVST, verify the setup with these commands:

```plaintext
Switch# show vlan brief
Switch# show spanning-tree vlan 10
Switch# show spanning-tree vlan 20
```

These commands display VLAN details, root bridge status, and port states, confirming the correct paths and loop-free topology.

## Benefits of STP and PVST in This Network

1. **Redundancy and Resilience**: In case of a link failure, STP automatically reroutes traffic along backup paths, ensuring network availability.
2. **Efficient Traffic Management**: PVST allows for separate root bridges for each VLAN, balancing network traffic and reducing congestion.
3. **Loop Prevention**: STP disables redundant links, preventing broadcast storms and ensuring data integrity.
4. **Scalability**: By separating traffic per VLAN, the network can scale more effectively, accommodating additional departments or nodes with minimal configuration.
