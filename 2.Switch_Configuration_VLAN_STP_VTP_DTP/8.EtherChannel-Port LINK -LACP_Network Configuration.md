# Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) Configuration for VLAN Trunking

## Overview

This network topology demonstrates the implementation of **Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)** for link aggregation between switches. LACP is an IEEE standard (802.3ad) used to combine multiple physical links into a single logical link (EtherChannel) and manage them dynamically. This configuration provides high availability and improved performance by enabling parallel link utilization and automatic recovery in case of link failure.

In this setup, LACP is used to establish a **trunk connection** between switches on **two floors** with separate VLANs for different teams (HR Team on VLAN 10 and Finance Team on VLAN 20). The aim is to facilitate inter-VLAN communication while using LACP to manage bandwidth and redundancy for inter-switch connections.

## Background on LACP

**LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)** is an open standard protocol that allows network devices to negotiate and automatically configure link aggregation. It operates in two modes:

- **Active Mode**: The port actively tries to form an LACP EtherChannel by initiating the link aggregation.
- **Passive Mode**: The port forms an LACP EtherChannel only if it receives LACP packets from another device.

LACP provides flexibility in multi-vendor networks, as it is compatible with both Cisco and non-Cisco devices, unlike Ciscoâ€™s proprietary PAgP.

## Network Topology

The network topology includes:

- **Two floors** with separate VLANs:
  - **VLAN 10** for the HR Team.
  - **VLAN 20** for the Finance Team.
- **Multiple access ports** on each switch connecting end devices (PCs and printers) to the respective VLANs.
- **EtherChannel links** using LACP between switches to provide redundancy and increased bandwidth for inter-switch communication.


## Objectives

1. Configure **VLANs** to separate traffic for the HR and Finance teams.
2. Set up **EtherChannel** using LACP between switches to support VLAN trunking.
3. Enable **trunk ports** on the aggregated links to allow inter-VLAN traffic between switches.

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Configure VLANs on Each Switch

Define the VLANs to separate the traffic for different departments.

**Example Configuration for VLAN 10 and VLAN 20:**
```plaintext
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name HR
Switch(config-vlan)# exit

Switch(config)# vlan 20
Switch(config-vlan)# name FINANCE
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
```

This configuration should be applied to all switches to ensure VLAN consistency across the network.

### Step 2: Assign Access Ports to VLANs

Assign access ports on each switch to the appropriate VLANs based on the floor layout and department requirements.

**Example Configuration for Access Ports on Floor 1:**
```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface range fa0/2-6
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config-if-range)# exit

Switch(config)# interface range fa0/7-11
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 20
Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

### Step 3: Configure LACP on EtherChannel Ports

To set up LACP for link aggregation, configure the required ports as part of an EtherChannel group and specify the channel mode (Active or Passive).

#### Option 1: Configure LACP in **Active Mode** (Active initiation)
```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface range fa0/15-17
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# channel-protocol lacp
Switch(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode active
Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

#### Option 2: Configure LACP in **Passive Mode** (Passive initiation)
```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface range fa0/15-17
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# channel-protocol lacp
Switch(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode passive
Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

### Step 4: Configure Trunking on EtherChannel Link

Enable trunking on the EtherChannel interface to allow VLAN traffic to traverse the aggregated link between switches.

```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface port-channel 1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
Switch(config-if)# exit
```

This configuration should be applied to all switches that are part of the EtherChannel to ensure VLAN trunking is enabled across the link.

## Verification Commands

After configuring LACP, VLANs, and trunking, use the following commands to verify the setup:

1. **Verify EtherChannel Status**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show etherchannel summary
   ```
   This command shows the status of the EtherChannel, including active ports and the protocol used (LACP).

2. **Check Trunking Status**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show interface port-channel 1 switchport
   ```
   This command confirms that the EtherChannel port is operating as a trunk.

3. **Verify VLAN Membership**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show vlan brief
   ```
   This command lists VLAN assignments for each port, ensuring that access ports are correctly assigned to VLAN 10 or VLAN 20.

4. **View LACP Neighbor Information**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show lacp neighbor
   ```
   This command displays details about neighboring devices and confirms that LACP is actively managing the EtherChannel.

## Practical Use Cases

1. **Increased Bandwidth**: Aggregating multiple physical links increases the available bandwidth for inter-switch traffic, which is essential for large departments like HR and Finance.
2. **Redundancy**: LACP provides fault tolerance. If one link in the EtherChannel fails, the remaining links continue to handle traffic without disrupting connectivity.
3. **Vendor Compatibility**: LACP, as an open standard, allows for link aggregation between Cisco and non-Cisco switches, providing flexibility in multi-vendor environments.
