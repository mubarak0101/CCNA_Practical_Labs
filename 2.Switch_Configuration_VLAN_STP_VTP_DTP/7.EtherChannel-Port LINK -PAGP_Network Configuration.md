# Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) Configuration for VLAN Trunking

## Overview

This network topology demonstrates the implementation of **Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)** for link aggregation between switches. PAgP, a Cisco proprietary protocol, is used to create and manage EtherChannel connections by aggregating multiple physical links into a single logical link. This configuration provides increased bandwidth, redundancy, and load balancing while simplifying network management.

In this setup, PAgP is configured to aggregate ports between switches on **two floors** with separate VLANs for different teams (HR Team on VLAN 10 and Finance Team on VLAN 20). The goal is to enable trunking for inter-VLAN communication across the floors while using PAgP to ensure efficient use of bandwidth and enhanced reliability.

## Background on PAgP

**Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)** dynamically manages the bundling of physical links to create an EtherChannel. PAgP can automatically detect links that can be aggregated and assists with configuration and maintenance. It operates in two modes:

- **Auto Mode**: A passive mode in which the port responds to PAgP packets but does not initiate them.
- **Desirable Mode**: An active mode where the port initiates PAgP packets to actively form an EtherChannel.

PAgP ensures that all member ports in the EtherChannel have matching configurations (speed, duplex, VLAN information) and helps prevent loops by making use of a single logical connection rather than multiple individual links.

## Network Topology

The network topology includes:

- **Two floors** with separate VLANs:
  - **VLAN 10** for HR Team.
  - **VLAN 20** for Finance Team.
- **Multiple access ports** on each switch connecting end devices (PCs and printers) to the respective VLANs.
- **EtherChannel links** using PAgP between switches to provide redundant connections and increased bandwidth for inter-switch communication.

## Objectives

1. Configure **VLANs** to separate traffic for HR and Finance teams.
2. Set up **EtherChannel** using PAgP between switches to support VLAN trunking.
3. Enable **trunk ports** on the aggregated links to allow inter-VLAN traffic between switches.

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Configure VLANs on Each Switch
Define the VLANs to separate the traffic for different departments.

**Example Configuration for VLAN 10 and VLAN 20:**
```plaintext
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name HR
Switch(config-vlan)# exit

Switch(config)# vlan 20
Switch(config-vlan)# name FINANCE
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
```

This configuration should be applied to all switches to ensure VLAN consistency across the network.

### Step 2: Assign Access Ports to VLANs
Assign access ports on each switch to the appropriate VLANs based on the floor layout and department requirements.

**Example Configuration for Access Ports on Floor 1:**
```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface range fa0/2-6
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config-if-range)# exit

Switch(config)# interface range fa0/7-11
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 20
Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

### Step 3: Configure PAgP on EtherChannel Ports

To set up PAgP for link aggregation, configure the required ports as part of an EtherChannel group and specify the channel mode (Auto or Desirable).

#### Option 1: Configure PAgP in **Desirable Mode** (Active initiation)
```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface range fa0/15-17
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# channel-protocol pagp
Switch(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode desirable
Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

#### Option 2: Configure PAgP in **Auto Mode** (Passive initiation)
```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface range fa0/15-17
Switch(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if-range)# channel-protocol pagp
Switch(config-if-range)# channel-group 1 mode auto
Switch(config-if-range)# exit
```

### Step 4: Configure Trunking on EtherChannel Link

Enable trunking on the EtherChannel interface to allow VLAN traffic to traverse the aggregated link between switches.

```plaintext
Switch(config)# interface port-channel 1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
Switch(config-if)# exit
```

This configuration should be applied to all switches that are part of the EtherChannel to ensure VLAN trunking is enabled across the link.

## Verification Commands

After configuring PAgP, VLANs, and trunking, use the following commands to verify the setup:

1. **Verify EtherChannel Status**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show etherchannel summary
   ```
   This command shows the status of the EtherChannel, including active ports and the protocol used (PAgP).

2. **Check Trunking Status**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show interface port-channel 1 switchport
   ```
   This command confirms that the EtherChannel port is operating as a trunk.

3. **Verify VLAN Membership**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show vlan brief
   ```
   This command lists VLAN assignments for each port, ensuring that access ports are correctly assigned to VLAN 10 or VLAN 20.

4. **View PAgP Neighbor Information**
   ```plaintext
   Switch# show pagp neighbor
   ```
   This command displays details about neighboring devices and confirms that PAgP is actively managing the EtherChannel.

## Practical Use Cases

1. **Increased Bandwidth**: Aggregating multiple physical links increases the available bandwidth for inter-switch traffic, which is essential for large departments like HR and Finance.
2. **Redundancy**: PAgP provides fault tolerance. If one link in the EtherChannel fails, the remaining links continue to handle traffic without disrupting connectivity.
3. **Simplified Management**: Using a single logical link (EtherChannel) to represent multiple physical links simplifies network management and reduces complexity.

## Summary

This configuration guide provides a comprehensive setup for VLANs, PAgP, and EtherChannel trunking. By aggregating links with PAgP, the network gains increased bandwidth, enhanced redundancy, and streamlined management. This setup is well-suited for enterprise environments requiring inter-departmental communication and reliable, high-bandwidth links between switches.

This README offers detailed information to configure and verify PAgP in a Cisco network environment, with use cases that highlight the importance of link aggregation in enterprise networks.
